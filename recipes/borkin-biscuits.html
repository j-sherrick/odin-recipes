        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Treats:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Frosting:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons hot water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and the egg. Add the peanut butter, water, and honey, and stir until you have a stiff dough. The dough becomes very firm and sticky. You may need to use your hands, or the paddle attachment on your mixer.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough about ½-inch thick and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes. The treats barely spread and rise, so get creative with your shapes.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, until golden. Once done, set aside to cool. (If you have smaller cookies, use less time, otherwise the bottom might burn.)</li>
            <li>To make the frosting, combine the peanut butter and honey in a microwavable bowl, and heat in the microwave in 15 second increments, stirring in between, until melted.</li>
            <li>Add the melted peanut butter mixture to the cornstarch and stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>Slowly add in the water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have reached the consistency that you would like. For a thinner frosting, add more water.</li>
            <li>Add the frosting to a piping bag and pipe designs on top of each dog treat.</li>
            <li>Frost the treats with the peanut butter/honey mixture for an even more tempting cookie.</li>
        </ol>
